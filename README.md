## Unit test module assignment

This is the unit test assignment. All frameworks needed are added as a dependency.
In case the choosen IDE misses something calling *mvn clean install* from command line should do the trick.

If you got stuck somewhere I suggest the google :). I have choosen tools that are widely used.

### The assignment:
* There are some classes which should be covered with unit tests.
* As a help I added the empty test classes
* There are some minor, not really Java specific implementation errors in the source code. If you choose your test cases well they should be easy to spot. The assignment includes the fixing of those issues. Please mark with comment where you did this and why.
* Other changes in the code are not allowed.
### The final goal:
* The source code should be well covered with unit test, but don't overdo it
* The above mentioned implementation problems should be fixed with comment
* If we call *mvn test* command all test should run and be successful

### Handing in:
* zip the entire library
* remove the extension ('.zip', this is because of virus checks) and use your neptun code as the file name
* Please send it to **zoltan_pozsonyi@epam.com**
* **DEADLINE IS 8:00 AM, 24th October**

### Evaluation:
I will check:
* How well are the different cases covered with unit test
* How well do you follow the discussed best practices (GIVEN/WHEN/THEN, exception testing, mocking dependencies)

In the end you will get a point between 0 and 10.
***
There are no Java magic here, if you got stuck you should be able to solve it with google.

And because of that if someone sends in a solution where:
* there is some kind of compile error (in the test or in the fixed source code)
* the tests are running, but there is even one that's failing
will get 0 point without further checking.

**However** if you send the assignment I will check it within 24 hours for those errors and you will get **one chance** to fix it if if can happen before the deadline. So it would be best not to send it in in the last minute.

Other than that no follow-up fix will be accepted.

If you keep in mind what we have talked about you should be fine.

### GOOD LUCK!
